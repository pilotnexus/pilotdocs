# Getting Started
<p class="sub1">Get your hardware setup up and running in 10 minutes</p>

Before you get started with the Pilot Automation Platform, you need a bit of Hardware:

1. Raspberry Pi
2. [Pilot Mainboard](https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/semiconductor-development-kit-accessories/8474894/)
3. One or more [Pilot Module(s)](https://uk.rs-online.com/web/c/?sra=oss&r=t&searchTerm=amescon+module)


### 1. Download Image 
Use the [pilotetcher app](https://github.com/amescon/pilotetcher/releases/) to burn a preconfigured image to a SD card

### 2. Configure Firmware
To configure the firmware for your modules you need to run [*pilot setup*](/docs/getting-started/install-pilot-config.md) first.
After that you can communicate with your modules.

### 3. Monitor and Control from Anywhere
If you want to connect it to the cloud and monitor/remote control the Rasbperry Pi with the App or the Pilot API, you need to [install pilotnode](/docs/getting-started/install-pilotnode.md).
