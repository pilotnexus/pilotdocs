# Getting Started
<p class="sub1">Get your hardware setup up and running in less than ten minutes</p>

Before you get started with the Pilot Nexus automation platform you'll need some hardware:

1. Raspberry Pi
2. [Pilot Nexus main board](https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/semiconductor-development-kit-accessories/8474894/)
3. One or more [Pilot Nexus plugin modules](https://uk.rs-online.com/web/c/?sra=oss&r=t&searchTerm=amescon+module)


### 1. Flash Image
Use the [*pilotetcher app*](/docs/getting-started/etcher.md) to download and flash a preconfigured image to a SD card.


### 2. Configure Firmware
To configure the firmware for your modules you need to run [*pilot setup*](/docs/getting-started/pilot-setup.md) first.
After that you can communicate with your modules.

### 3. Monitor and Control from anywhere
If you want to connect it to the cloud and monitor/remote control the Rasbperry Pi with the App or the Pilot Nexus API, you need to [*configure pilotnode*](/docs/getting-started/pilot-node-setup.md).
