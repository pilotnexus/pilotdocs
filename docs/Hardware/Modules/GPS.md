### Optional / Nice to know

The module has a battery connector with labeled + and - pins.
You can connect any Battery or LiPo here as long as the voltage is between 2.0 and 4.3 Volt.
Typically you would connect a CR2032 coincell or similar.

If power was not preserved, the GPS module will perform a lengthy cold start every time it is powered-on because previous satellite information is not retained and needs to be retransmitted. This Information can be stored and reused by connecting a small battery to the *battery backup* pins.
