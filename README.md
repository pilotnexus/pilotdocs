## What is Pilot?


PiLOT Ctrl provides you with the ability to upgrade [SBCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer) (single-board computers) into very powerful control platforms.

With a range of low-cost plugin modules available, each backed by rich software applications designed to make installation and operation easy, PiLOT is ideal for managing industrial automation, home automation, and vastly improving upon the communications between multiple control devices.

This SBC extension has been built to encompass a huge range of potential applications. PiLOT Ctrl is not only an expanded connectivity layer, itâ€™s a complete, hardware to firmware technology stack that integrates everything from task-specific drivers to cloud storage.
